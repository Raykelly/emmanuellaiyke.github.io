<p>The end of one life is yet the beginning of another. A fresh green bean seed cannot germinate when it is planted, only a dry bean seed can. The germination of a new bean plant marks the end of an old life and the beginning of a new one...It is a period of transformation. The end of a path or a road is not necessarily the finishing point. See it as a zone of transformation....a zone of renewal.</p>

<p>It takes a couple of days for the bean seed to germinate...It could also take some time for you to achieve your goal. A bean seed in the soil may see no hope of getting out...Little does it know that it will germinate into a new seedling.</p>

<p>In your point of despair; always remember that TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER THAN TODAY AND YESTERDAY. Listen to #thethinvoice.</p>
